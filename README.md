# gameMode

The intention of this project is to stop or start multiple processes with a single click. 

When gaming, it is desireable to have as many computing resources available as possible;
in other words, have as few other processes running aside from the game as possible.

This project will allow the user to create a list of programs which they want to run under
non-gaming use scenerios, but not during gaming. When beginning a gaming session, the user
can click a button to have all of the listed processes stopped. When the gaming session is
complete, the user will again click the button, restarting the processes which were stopped.
